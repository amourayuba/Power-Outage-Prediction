## Questions to think about

### Time
1. Is there seasonality to lightning? Is there seasonality to power cuts? Therefore is there more power cuts due to seasons?

(Maybe do a histogram/distribution over a single year and plot both)

2. Now over the past couple of decades, were there some years that had more power cuts? Basically plot a histogram across multiple years now as the x axis.

### Place (More DataViz oriented)
3. Can we draw it on a map? Maybe then we can also have a time slider to either do it for a single year, or for a whole range of years, and we show where the power cuts happened and also where the lightning happened?
